### Description
"Methanprombank" is looking for an analyst proficient in Python. Your main tasks will include customer churn analysis and bank user segmentation. Segmentation will show how customers use our services.
In projects in this domain, you will analyze relationships and create several types of visualizations.
#### Client: Marketing Department.

#### Who needs the information?: The information is needed by the manager responsible for marketing campaigns and who closely collaborates with product managers.

#### What do they want to achieve?: To effectively identify customer churn segments to ensure they are homogeneous, highly churn-prone, and cover maximum problematic areas of the bank. Consequently, marketing efforts targeting these segments should lead to a reduction in churn.

#### Why is there a need for research?: Customer churn in the bank has dramatically increased recently, becoming a problem threatening the bank's existence.

Have such studies been conducted before?: Previous studies were conducted, and a dashboard was created based on them. However, it has become outdated, and it is currently unclear what the problem is and how to solve it. The bank's customer composition has changed, and the old segments no longer apply.
